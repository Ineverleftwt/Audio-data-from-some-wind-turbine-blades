# Audio-data-from-some-wind-turbine-blades
Here is some audio data for wind turbine blades(Real&amp;&amp;Simulated)

# Introduction
The microphone used for this data collection is a PCB 378C10 random incident microphone, which is mounted approximately 15m directly below the wind turbine pole.

# Why is PCB 378C10?
Construction: With a 1/4-inch microphone diameter, the PCB 378C10 is a relatively compact design, which may make it ideal for use in a variety of environments.

Frequency Response: The PCB 378C10 has a frequency range of ±2dB from 5 to 70,000 Hz. This wide frequency range may make it capable of capturing a wide range of sounds, including high and low frequency sounds.

Dynamic range: The dynamic range is 173 dB re 20 µPa, which may mean that the transducer is able to maintain good performance at different sound levels, including at very high or very low sound levels.

# Necessary Explanation
Inevitably, there is some high-frequency noise in some audio collection processes, which is mainly related to some blades with varying degrees of damage cracks. We have made some artificial changes to the audio, but we have done our best to ensure that the audio is intact. Therefore, there is an error in the experimental effect, but we do not believe that this affects its ability to be used as a basis for research.

# Data Description
The uploaded 12-minute audio contains damage signals.
